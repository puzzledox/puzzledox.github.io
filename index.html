        <h2>The Role of Computer Systems in the modern world</h2>

        <p>Computer systems have quicky evolved in the past century. They are a vital resource that have ultimately altered the way today’s society works, communicates, entertains, and educates. Computers benefit the business and personal world by being able to do the following more efficiently: buying and selling products, communicating throughout the world, enhancing our knowledge, job influences, entertainment, research, and paying bills. We’re now capable of creating new, more and better quality tasks via computer technology.</p>

        <h3>Global Education during a pandemic</h3>

        <p>These unprecendented times have proved to be a big challenge for educators and students. Without the internet, education would have been nearly impossible. Today, we can "attend" school completely online, never having to step foot outside of our homes. </p>
